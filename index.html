        <h2>2. The Godfather</h2>
        <p>The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of

            wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man,
            and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful
            and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it.
            What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the
            thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could
